## Description
The purpose of Scale In policy for ASG is to only increase the instances when the disk space is used beyond certain threshold. This is useful if we are working with e.g. Elasticsearch clusters where data is continuously coming and with increase in data we can increase the number of instances.
This stack will by default create three instances and if disk space on average is above then 40% by default then it'll raise an alarm which will in turn increase the instances on-by-one until alarm is off.
